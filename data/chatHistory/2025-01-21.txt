user: i have more feedback, the cost of living vouchers not enough man	2025-01-21 00:33:34

assistant: Thank you for your feedback.

I understand that you feel the cost of living vouchers are not enough.

The Budget 2024 includes several measures to help with the cost of living.

*   CDC Vouchers:
    *   An additional S\$600 in CDC vouchers will be given to all Singaporean households.
    *   The first S\$300 will be disbursed in end-June 2024.
    *   The remaining S\$300 will be disbursed in January 2025.
    *   This is in addition to the S\$500 vouchers disbursed earlier in 2024.

*   Cost-of-Living Special Payment:
    *   Eligible Singaporeans will receive a cash payment of between S\$200 and S\$400.
    *   To be eligible, you must be a Singaporean citizen aged 21 and above in 2024, living in Singapore, own no more than one property, and have an assessable income of up to S\$100,000.

*   U-Save Rebates:
    *   Eligible HDB households will receive additional U-Save rebates to help with utility bills.
    *   The rebates will be disbursed in April, July, October, and January.
    *   The total U-Save rebates will be 2.5 times the amount of regular GSTV-U Save rebates, or up to S\$950 in total.

*   S&CC Rebates:
    *   Eligible HDB households will also receive additional S&CC rebates.
    *   Together with the regular S&CC rebates, households will receive up to four months of such rebates in FY2024.

These measures are designed to provide more support to lower-income families and larger households, particularly those with seniors and children.

assistant: Thank you for your feedback.

I understand you would like the CDC vouchers to provide more support.

Here is some information about the CDC vouchers from the Budget 2024 documents:

*   **Amount:**
    *   Each Singaporean household will receive an additional S\$600 in CDC vouchers.
    *   This is in addition to the S\$500 in CDC vouchers disbursed in January 2024.
    *   This means a total of S\$1100 in CDC vouchers will be given in 2024 and 2025.

*   **Disbursement:**
    *   The first S\$300 of the additional S\$600 will be disbursed at the end of June 2024.
    *   The remaining S\$300 will be disbursed in January 2025.

*   **Usage:**
    *   The vouchers can be used at participating heartland merchants and hawkers, as well as participating supermarkets.

The documents also mention that lower-income families and larger households with seniors and children receive more support through the Assurance Package, which includes the CDC vouchers and other measures.
