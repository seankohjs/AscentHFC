user: i have more feedback, the cost of living vouchers not enough man	2025-01-21 00:33:34

assistant: Thank you for your feedback.

I understand that you feel the cost of living vouchers are not enough.

The Budget 2024 includes several measures to help with the cost of living.

*   CDC Vouchers:
    *   An additional S\$600 in CDC vouchers will be given to all Singaporean households.
    *   The first S\$300 will be disbursed in end-June 2024.
    *   The remaining S\$300 will be disbursed in January 2025.
    *   This is in addition to the S\$500 vouchers disbursed earlier in 2024.

*   Cost-of-Living Special Payment:
    *   Eligible Singaporeans will receive a cash payment of between S\$200 and S\$400.
    *   To be eligible, you must be a Singaporean citizen aged 21 and above in 2024, living in Singapore, own no more than one property, and have an assessable income of up to S\$100,000.

*   U-Save Rebates:
    *   Eligible HDB households will receive additional U-Save rebates to help with utility bills.
    *   The rebates will be disbursed in April, July, October, and January.
    *   The total U-Save rebates will be 2.5 times the amount of regular GSTV-U Save rebates, or up to S\$950 in total.

*   S&CC Rebates:
    *   Eligible HDB households will also receive additional S&CC rebates.
    *   Together with the regular S&CC rebates, households will receive up to four months of such rebates in FY2024.

These measures are designed to provide more support to lower-income families and larger households, particularly those with seniors and children.

assistant: I understand you're asking specifically about the GST rate itself.

The provided documents do not mention the specific GST rate. However, they do mention that the GST increase is meant to pre-fund rising healthcare expenditure and that the government has enhanced the Assurance Package to help Singaporeans cope with the GST increase.

Would you like to know more about any of the support measures related to the GST increase?
