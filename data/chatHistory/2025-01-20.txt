user: i have some feedback regarding the CDC vouchers, i dont think they are enough	2025-01-20 22:46:33

assistant: I understand you have feedback that the CDC vouchers are not enough.

Based on the Budget 2024 documents, here's what I can tell you about the CDC vouchers:

*   **Amount:**
    *   In 2024, each Singaporean household will receive a total of \$800 in CDC vouchers.
        *   \$500 was disbursed in January 2024.
        *   An additional \$300 will be disbursed at the end of June 2024.
    *   In 2025, each Singaporean household will receive \$300 in CDC vouchers, disbursed in January 2025.
*   **Usage:** The vouchers can be used at participating heartland merchants and hawkers, as well as participating supermarkets.
*   **Eligibility:** Households with at least one Singapore citizen are eligible. No application is required.

The Budget 2024 documents also mention additional support measures to help with the cost of living. These include:

*   **Cost-of-Living Special Payment:** A one-off cash payment of \$200 to \$400 for eligible adult Singaporeans.
*   **U-Save Rebates:** Eligible HDB households can receive up to \$950 in U-Save rebates in FY2024 to help with utility bills.
*   **S&CC Rebates:** Eligible HDB households will receive up to four months of Service and Conservancy Charges rebates in FY2024.

To better understand your feedback, could you please specify what you feel is insufficient about the CDC vouchers? For example, are you concerned about the total amount, the frequency of disbursement, or the places where the vouchers can be used?
