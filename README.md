# Gemini Chatbot - Quick Start

This chatbot uses Google's Gemini model.  Here's how to run it:

**1. Setup:**

* **API Key:**  Get your Gemini API key and put it in a `.env` file like this:

```
GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY
```

* **Install:**  Make sure you have Python 3.9+ and install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**2. Run:**

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Open the URL shown in your terminal (usually `http://localhost:8501`).


**3. Chat:**  Type in the input box and press Enter.


That's it!
```

This shortened version focuses on the essential steps to get the chatbot running quickly.  It's ideal if your teammates are already familiar with basic Python and Streamlit concepts.  Still, including a `requirements.txt` and clear instructions for the API key is crucial for smooth setup.
